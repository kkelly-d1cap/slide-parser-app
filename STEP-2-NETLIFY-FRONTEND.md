# Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify (30 minutes)

## üéØ What We're Doing
Setting up the "face" of your Slide Parser app on Netlify. This is the website your team will visit to use the application.

## üìã **Part A: Create Netlify Account (5 minutes)**

### 1. Go to Netlify
- **Open your browser** and go to: `https://netlify.com`
- **Click "Sign up"** (top right corner)

### 2. Choose Sign-Up Method
**Recommended:** Sign up with GitHub (easier for future updates)
- **Click "Sign up with GitHub"**
- **Authorize Netlify** to access your GitHub account

**Alternative:** Sign up with email
- **Enter your email and password**
- **Verify your email address**

### 3. Complete Profile
- **Skip team setup** (click "Skip" if prompted)
- **You should see the Netlify dashboard**

## üìã **Part B: Deploy Your Frontend (10 minutes)**

### 1. Deploy Site
- **Click "Add new site"** (or "Deploy to Netlify")
- **Select "Deploy manually"**

### 2. Upload Your Files
- **Drag and drop** the `frontend-for-netlify.zip` file I provided
- **OR click "browse to upload"** and select the zip file
- **Netlify will automatically extract** and deploy

### 3. Wait for Deployment
- **You'll see "Site deploy in progress"**
- **Wait 1-2 minutes** for completion
- **You'll get a random URL** like `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`

### 4. Test Your Site
- **Click the generated URL**
- **You should see the Slide Parser interface**
- **Try entering fund information** (it should work)

---

## üìã **Part C: Configure Backend Connection (10 minutes)**

### 1. Update Frontend Configuration
**Problem:** Your frontend needs to know where your backend is.

**Solution:** Update the API URL in your frontend code.

#### **Easy Method: Site Settings**
- **Go to Site settings** in Netlify dashboard
- **Click "Environment variables"**
- **Add new variable:**
  ```
  Key: VITE_API_BASE_URL
  Value: https://yourcompany-slide-parser.herokuapp.com/api/slides
  ```
- **Click "Save"**
- **Trigger new deploy** (Site overview ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí "Trigger deploy")

#### **Alternative: Code Update**
If environment variables don't work:
1. **Download your frontend source code**
2. **Edit `src/App.jsx`**
3. **Find line with `localhost:5000`**
4. **Replace with your Heroku URL**
5. **Re-build and re-upload**

### 2. Update CORS Settings
- **Go back to your Heroku app**
- **Settings ‚Üí Config Vars**
- **Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS:**
  ```
  Value: https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app
  ```
- **Replace with your actual Netlify URL**

---

## üìã **Part D: Test Integration (5 minutes)**

### 1. Test the Connection
- **Go to your Netlify site**
- **Enter fund information**
- **Try uploading a PDF**

### 2. Expected Results:
**‚úÖ Success:** Upload works, shows "Processing PDF..."
**‚ùå Error:** "Failed to fetch" or CORS error

### 3. If You Get Errors:
**Most Common Issue:** CORS configuration
- **Double-check** your Netlify URL in Heroku ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- **Make sure** there are no typos
- **Wait 2-3 minutes** for changes to take effect
- **Try again**

## üé® **Optional: Custom Domain (10 minutes)**

### If You Want a Custom URL:
Instead of `amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`, you can have `slideparser.yourcompany.com`
